                This project was made as a way to try and showcase my skills while
                also learning new ones. I got the idea to create this site all from one
                reddit post. It was a user who had posted there portfolio website
                in an attempt to get feedback. The website at that time was pretty low quality
                from a design standpoint. The color theme was way too dark and the font was way too small. 
                The website's layout was horrible, and the website broke almost in it's entirely when anyone attempted
                to pull it up on mobile. The part of this story that got me motivated to create this site was the fact that
                the user did not care about what others' said about his portfolio website. He was there looking for ways to improve
                his website, so he did not listen to those that mocked his design or made fun of his website. Instead he only responded to those with
                actual feedback and he started to implement the feedback into his website (he made a follow-up post about a month later),
                and even though the website still wasn't the best he was still improving it each day, whether it be a better de
                sign, a better font, or a better color theme. He never stopped.

                That one user got me motivated in that moment to create this site. I decided to follow his lead and create a site that may not be the best, but it will
                be a site that I can be proud of. That I can continue to improve, and that will be able to showcase what I learn.
                I would also like to give a massive thank you to the user who inspired me to create this site. Even though I may not remembered your username, 
                I know that I will never forget his will to continue on, and I will do my best to try and follow his example.
